They dislike ambiguity and shortcuts. To truly succeed, they must learn to embrace innovation and delegate, realizing that not everyone works at their unrelenting pace.</div>",
        "Love & Relationships": "<div>Love for an Ox is a marathon, not a sprint. They are not prone to whirlwind romances or impulsive flings. Instead, they seek a partner with whom they can build a stable, lasting life. <br/><br/><strong>Relationship Dynamics:</strong> Once committed, the Ox is incredibly loyal and protective. They show love through provision and reliability—fixing things, managing finances, and being a rock for their partner. They value shared morals and practical goals over dramatic displays of affection.<br/><br/><strong>Challenges:</strong> Their stoicism can be mistaken for indifference. Oxen need to learn to verbalize their feelings to avoid emotional distance. They can also be slow to trust, requiring patience from potential partners.</div>",
        "Zodiac Compatibility": "<div>The Ox seeks a partner who appreciates stability and shares their traditional values.<br/><br/><strong>Best Matches:</strong> <br/>- <strong>Rat:</strong> The resourceful Rat brings smarts that complement the Ox's diligence.<br/>- <strong>Snake:</strong> Offers wisdom and intuition that fascinates the practical Ox.<br/>- <strong>Rooster:</strong> Shares the Ox's love for order and hard work.<br/><br/><strong>Challenging Matches:</strong> <br/>- <strong>Goat:</strong> Too dreamy and emotional for the grounded Ox.<br/>- <strong>Horse:</strong> Their need for freedom clashes with the Ox's need for routine.</div>",

They also enjoy history, appreciating the lessons of the past. While not typically 'artsy,' they can excel in architecture or classical music, where precision and discipline are required.</div>",
        "Health Tendencies": "<div>Robust and strong, Oxen often possess great physical stamina. They can work long hours without tiring. However, this same endurance can lead them to ignore warning signs until it's too late.<br/><br/><strong>Watch Out For:</strong> Joint issues or back pain from overwork are common. They also tend to bottle up stress, which can lead to digestive or cardiovascular issues.<br/><br/><strong>Wellness Advice:</strong> Regular, low-impact exercise like swimming or hiking is excellent. Crucially, they must learn to mentally unplug and relax, as their sense of duty often prevents them from taking necessary breaks.</div>",

They love with their whole heart and aren't afraid to show it. <br/><br/><strong>Relationship Dynamics:</strong> They need a partner who can handle their energy without trying to tame them. Independence is key; a Tiger needs space to roam. If they feel trapped, they will flee. However, to those they love, they are fiercely loyal and generously affectionate.<br/><br/><strong>Challenges:</strong> Their desire for dominance can cause friction.
